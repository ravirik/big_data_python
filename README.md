This code first defines the URL for the GitHub API and the DigitalOcean server details. It then specifies the repository and file path on GitHub to retrieve the data from.

The code makes a GET request to the GitHub API to retrieve the file contents and decodes the Base64-encoded content. It then writes the decoded content to a temporary file and uses SCP to transfer the file to the specified server.

Finally, the code removes the temporary file. You can schedule this code to run periodically to keep your data pipeline up-to-date. Note that you'll need to install the requests library and have the scp command line tool installed on your machine.
